Tempered Scale
Tone Equal Temperment - TET
Equal Division of the Octave - EDO
all interchangeable, somewhat arbitrary
EDO is my personal preference
so lets go with that

necessary objects
-waveform
-input
-output

necessary functions
-generate specific pitch per input
-send specific pitch to output

waveform is saved as a single cycle,
pitch is defined as a Hz value
(cycle

inputs are labelled with a number to
be assigned to a specific Hz value
