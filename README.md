Microtonal Instruments

The code contained in these 
repositories are for the service of 
building microtonal instruments.

These projects are currently modeled 
with a default value of 440Hz for 
note A4, with the A octave serving 
as a connection to the 12EDO Scale.

This value can be changed by the 
user. However, the user must 
calculate the value of lowest 
possible value note in their 
preferred scale and enter it for 
variable SourceNote in the formula 
for instrument 1.
